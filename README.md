# Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset containing various health parameters and risk factors associated with cardiovascular diseases.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes features such as:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Blood pressure
- Cholesterol levels
- Fasting blood sugar levels
- Resting electrocardiographic results
- Maximum heart rate achieved
- Exercise-induced angina
- ST depression induced by exercise
- Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
- Thalassemia

## Requirements
To run this project, install the necessary dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To execute the Jupyter Notebook, run the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook Heart Disease Prediction.ipynb
```

## Models Used
The project explores different machine learning models, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks

## Evaluation Metrics
The models are evaluated based on:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- ROC-AUC score

## Results
The best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics, and the results are analyzed to determine its effectiveness in predicting heart disease.

## Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning for better model performance.
- Incorporating deep learning techniques for improved accuracy.
- Feature engineering and selection to enhance model robustness.
